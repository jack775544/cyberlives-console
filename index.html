            <p>So you have Javascript turned off. If you want the new site to work then I would advise to turn it back on. The script does nothing to track you or anything malicious. The source code is in console.js if you wish to survey it for yourself. JQuery and crypto-js are the only 3rd party libraries used.</p>
            <p>I promise I am not trying to blow up your computer (Disclaimer: This is not a guarentee for your computer not exploding).</p>
            <p>If you really don't want to use javascript then the legacy version of the site is <a href="index_legacy.html">here.</a></p>
